The samples and demos provided in this project (specifically the SCU client tests and WADO-RS retrieval examples)
were developed and tested against an Orthanc PACS server (https://www.orthanc-server.com/).

We have great respect for the Orthanc project and its contributors.

Note: DICOMPolice does not use Orthanc code and does not depend on Orthanc specifically.
The SCU / MADO generation tools are standard-compliant and will work against any DICOM SCP
